- We need to filter asc files and create geotiffs out of them (with various value ranges)
- We need to extract subcategories from geojsons and create geotiffs out of them
- We need to upload the results to mapbox

Issues:
We need a geojson for "cat_years_since_fire" to know what each number indicates
cat_type_disturbance doesn't have wind, other, or insect in the geojson 


./download_environment_layers.sh
./extract_continuous.py
./extract_subcategory.sh
./merge*
./patch_data_with_env_contributions.py
./rasterize_continuous.sh
./upload.sh # Change the prefix in the upload.sh to upload specific sets

Note: The merge* files map categories to numbers and change the filename so that they fit in Mapbox's filename size limitations. Ugh.
