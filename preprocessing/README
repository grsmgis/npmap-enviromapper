- We need to filter asc files and create geotiffs out of them (with various value ranges)
- We need to extract subcategories from geojsons and create geotiffs out of them
- We need to upload the results to mapbox

Issues:
We need a geojson for "cat_years_since_fire" to know what each number indicates
cat_type_disturbance doesn't have wind, other, or insect in the geojson
